## Testing Area for Future Dotty-Based Quill

To run, use `sbt compile`. Tests are currently not available
since scalatest has not been moved to 3.0.0-M2 yet.

This project should work with metals. To import, go to the
project directory and type `code .` to open VS Code
(note that it will have to be configured beforehand).
